## wiserbyfeller adapter for ioBroker

This Adapter enables you to manage all your Wiser-by-Feller system devices via a WebSocket connection.

## Installation requirements

* node.js >=12.0 is required
* js-controller >=3.0 is required
* Installed Wiser by Feller devices are required. More information can be found here: [Wiser by Feller](https://wiser.feller.ch/de/professionals).

## Supported Devices
* Wiser switchable light 1-channel #3401
* Wiser switchable light 2-channel #3402
* Wiser blind switch 1-channel #3404
* Wiser blind switch 2-channel #3405
* Wiser LED-universaldimmer 1-channel #3406
* Wiser LED-universaldimmer 2-channel #3407

## Usage
Trigger changes on states in folder `ACTONS`.

**Wiser switchable light:**

To turn on or off a load set the attribute `BRI` (brightness) to the following values:
* Turn off set the `.ACTIONS.BRI` attribute to `off`
* Turn on set the `.ACTIONS.BRI` attribute to `on`

**Wiser blind switch:**

On a motor e.g. shutter/blind you can set the target level between 0% and 100% (`0` - `10000`) and a tilt value.
* To set the shutter in open position set the `.ACTIONS.LEVEL` attribute to `0`
* To set the shutter in close position set the `.ACTIONS.LEVEL` attribute to `10000`
* To control the shutter set the `.ACTIONS.LEVEL` attribute between `1` and `10000` (e.g. set `.ACTIONS.LEVEL` to `5000`, means set the shutter/blind to position 50%)
* To control slats of a shutter (number of tilt) set the `.ACTIONS.TILT` attribute to a value `0` - `9`. Finally it's the motor running time, because we don't know the slat position in degrees.
* To control the position and the tilt attribute together, set the `.ACTIONS.leveltilt.SET` attribute to value `true`. The shutter/blind will move to the position of the two values `.ACTIONS.leveltilt.level` and `.ACTIONS.leveltilt.tilt`

**Wiser LED-universaldimmer**

On a dimmable light you can set the target brightness between 0% and 100% (`0` - `10000`).
* Turn off set the `.ACTIONS.BRI` attribute to `0`
* To dim set the `.ACTIONS.BRI` attribute between `1` and `10000` (e.g. set `.ACTIONS.BRI` to `5000`, means 50% of brightness)

<!--
