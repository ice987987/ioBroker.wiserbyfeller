* js-controller >=3.x is required
* Installed Wiser by Feller devices are required. More information can be found here: [Wiser by Feller](https://wiser.feller.ch/de/professionals).

* Wiser blind switch 2-channel #3405

* Wiser LED-universaldimmer 2-channel #3407

## Usage
Trigger changes on states in folder `ACTONS`.

**Wiser switchable light:**

To turn on or off a load set the attribute `bri` (brightness) to the following values:
* Turn off set the `bri` attribute to `0`
* Turn on set the `bri` attribute to `10000`

**Wiser blind switch:**

On a motor e.g. shutter/blind you can set the target level between 0% and 100% (0 - 10000) and a tilt value.
* To set the shutter in open position set the `level` attribute to `0`
* To set the shutter in close position set the `level` attribute to `10000`
* To control the shutter set the `level` attribute between `1` and `10000` (e.g. set `level` to 5000, means set the shutter/blind to position 50%)
* To control slats of a shutter (number of tilt) set the `tilt` attribute to a value `0` - `9`. Finally it's the motor running time, because we don't know the slat position in degrees.
* To control the position and the tilt attribute, set the `leveltilt` attribute to value `{"level": 3000, "tilt": 3}`

**Wiser LED-universaldimmer**

On a dimmable light you can set the target brightness between 0% and 100% (0 - 10000).
* Turn off set the `bri` attribute to `0`
* To dim set the `bri` attribute between `1` and `10000` (e.g. set `bri` to 5000, means 50% of brightness)
